     * - *Last Update* : The issue date and time of this CRL.
     * - *Next Update* : The day and time by which the next CRL will be issued.

     * - *Serial Number* : The serial number, in hexadecimal format, of the revoked certificate.

These actions are needed for the ACM principal to renew private PKI certificates requested through ACM and residing in the same AWS account as the CA.
 *
 * **About permissions** - If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use `AWS::ACMPCA::Permission` to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.
 * - For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list permissions.
 * - If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with AWS Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html) .
 *
 * > To update an `AWS::ACMPCA::Permission` resource, you must first delete the existing permission resource from the CloudFormation stack and then create a new permission resource with updated properties.
