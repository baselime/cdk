A single `PutMetricAlarm` call can include up to 20 `MetricDataQuery` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a `MetricStat` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the `Expression` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those `Expression` structures, one must have `true` as the value for `ReturnData` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.
     *
     * Any expression used in a `PutMetricAlarm` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
     *
     * Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a `GetMetricData` operation or a `PutMetricAlarm` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.
