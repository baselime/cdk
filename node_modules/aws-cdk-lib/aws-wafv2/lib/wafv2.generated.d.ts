 *
 * > You can define one logging destination per web ACL.
 *
 * You can access information about the traffic that AWS WAF inspects using the following steps:
 *
 * - Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
 *
 * The name that you give the destination must start with `aws-waf-logs-` . Depending on the type of destination, you might need to configure additional settings or permissions.
 *
 * For configuration requirements and pricing information for each destination type, see [Logging web ACL traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
 * - Associate your logging destination to your web ACL using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request.
 *
 * When you successfully enable logging using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request, AWS WAF creates an additional role or policy that is required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, AWS WAF creates a resource policy on the log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS WAF creates a bucket policy. For an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS WAF creates a service-linked role.

 *
 * Use an `RuleGroup` to define a collection of rules for inspecting and controlling web requests. You use a rule group in an `WebACL` by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the rule statement `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` , when you add rules to the web ACL.
 *
 * When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.

     * A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
     *
     * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .
     *
     * When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
     *
     * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
     *
     * - An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the address 192.0.2.44.
     * - A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.
     *
     * In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
     *
     * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

         *
         * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
         *
         * - An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the address 192.0.2.44.
         * - A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

         *
         * - Delete the following characters: `\ " ' ^`

         * - Replace the following characters with a space: `, ;`
         * - Replace multiple spaces with one space
         * - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

         * *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE* - Replace these characters with a space character (decimal 32):
         *
         * - `\f` , formfeed, decimal 12
         * - `\t` , tab, decimal 9
         * - `\n` , newline, decimal 10
         * - `\r` , carriage return, decimal 13
         * - `\v` , vertical tab, decimal 11
         * - Non-breaking space, decimal 160
         *
         * `COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.
         *
         * *CSS_DECODE* - Decode characters that were encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules `syndata.html#characters` . This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldn’t typically be encoded. It's also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal characters. For example, `ja\vascript` for javascript.
         *
         * *ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE* - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: `\a` , `\b` , `\f` , `\n` , `\r` , `\t` , `\v` , `\\` , `\?` , `\'` , `\"` , `\xHH` (hexadecimal), `\0OOO` (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.
         *
         * *HEX_DECODE* - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.
         *
         * *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. `HTML_ENTITY_DECODE` performs these operations:
         *
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)quot;` with `"`
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)nbsp;` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)lt;` with a "less than" symbol
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)gt;` with `>`
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, `(ampersand)#xhhhh;` , with the corresponding characters
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, `(ampersand)#nnnn;` , with the corresponding characters
         *
         * *JS_DECODE* - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a `\` `u` `HHHH` code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.
         *
         * *LOWERCASE* - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).
         *
         * *MD5* - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.
         *
         * *NONE* - Specify `NONE` if you don't want any text transformations.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH* - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN* - This is the same as `NORMALIZE_PATH` , but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes.
         *
         * *REMOVE_NULLS* - Remove all `NULL` bytes from the input.
         *
         * *REPLACE_COMMENTS* - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment ( `/* ... * /` ) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment ( `* /` ) is not acted upon.
         *
         * *REPLACE_NULLS* - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII `0x20` ).
         *
         * *SQL_HEX_DECODE* - Decode SQL hex data. Example ( `0x414243` ) will be decoded to ( `ABC` ).
         *
         * *URL_DECODE* - Decode a URL-encoded value.
         *
         * *URL_DECODE_UNI* - Like `URL_DECODE` , but with support for Microsoft-specific `%u` encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.
         *
         * *UTF8_TO_UNICODE* - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.

You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
     *
     * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .
     *
     * When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
     *
     * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
     *
     * - An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the address 192.0.2.44.
     * - A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.
     *
     * In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
     *
     * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

         *
         * - An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the address 192.0.2.44.
         * - A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

         * *ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE* - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: `\a` , `\b` , `\f` , `\n` , `\r` , `\t` , `\v` , `\\` , `\?` , `\'` , `\"` , `\xHH` (hexadecimal), `\0OOO` (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.
         *
         * *HEX_DECODE* - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.
         *
         * *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. `HTML_ENTITY_DECODE` performs these operations:
         *
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)quot;` with `"`
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)nbsp;` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)lt;` with a "less than" symbol
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)gt;` with `>`
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, `(ampersand)#xhhhh;` , with the corresponding characters
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, `(ampersand)#nnnn;` , with the corresponding characters
         *
         * *JS_DECODE* - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a `\` `u` `HHHH` code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.
         *
         * *LOWERCASE* - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).
         *
         * *MD5* - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.
         *
         * *NONE* - Specify `NONE` if you don't want any text transformations.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH* - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN* - This is the same as `NORMALIZE_PATH` , but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes.
         *
         * *REMOVE_NULLS* - Remove all `NULL` bytes from the input.
         *
         * *REPLACE_COMMENTS* - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment ( `/* ... * /` ) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment ( `* /` ) is not acted upon.
         *
         * *REPLACE_NULLS* - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII `0x20` ).
         *
         * *SQL_HEX_DECODE* - Decode SQL hex data. Example ( `0x414243` ) will be decoded to ( `ABC` ).
         *
         * *URL_DECODE* - Decode a URL-encoded value.
         *
         * *URL_DECODE_UNI* - Like `URL_DECODE` , but with support for Microsoft-specific `%u` encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.
         *
         * *UTF8_TO_UNICODE* - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.

 *
 * Use a web ACL association to define an association between a web ACL and a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AWS AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an AWS App Runner service.
 *
 * For Amazon CloudFront , don't use this resource. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL with a distribution, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the `WebACL` to your CloudFront distribution configuration. To disassociate a web ACL, provide an empty ARN. For information, see [AWS::CloudFront::Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-distribution.html) .
 *
 * When you create a web ACL or make changes to a web ACL or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, AWS WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an AWS resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.
