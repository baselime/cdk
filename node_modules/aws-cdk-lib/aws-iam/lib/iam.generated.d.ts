 * Creates a new virtual MFA device for the AWS account . After creating the virtual MFA, use [EnableMFADevice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_EnableMFADevice.html) to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see [Using a virtual MFA device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .
 *
 * For information about the maximum number of MFA devices you can create, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .
 *
 * > The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information. In other words, protect the seed information as you would your AWS access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures.
