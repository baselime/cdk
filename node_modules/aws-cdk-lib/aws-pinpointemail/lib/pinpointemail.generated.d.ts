By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address or domain, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from that identity.

 * When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.
